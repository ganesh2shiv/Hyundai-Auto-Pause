Do you miss the pause button on your Hyundai/Kia car's steering? This android app enables the existing mute button to also work as pause button while playing music on Android Auto.

It works by establishing a connection with the car's infotainment system using the classic bluetooth (not BLE) and observes the volume change/mute events.
